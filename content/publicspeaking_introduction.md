This document summarizes key takeaways from our internal public speaking training.  It's intended for personal review and reinforcement.

# What is public speaking
Public speaking is more than just talking in front of a crowd. It's a structured form of communication where a speaker delivers information or persuades an audience.  It encompasses several key elements:

- **Content**: This refers to the message itself – the information, arguments, and stories you're sharing. Strong content is well-researched, organized, and relevant to your audience.
- **Delivery**: This is how you present your message – your vocal tone, body language, eye contact, and use of visual aids. Effective delivery engages the audience and reinforces your content.
- **Audience Connection**: This is about building a rapport with your listeners. It involves understanding their needs and interests, speaking their language, and creating a sense of shared understanding.

It's the interplay of these three elements that makes public speaking truly effective. It's a skill that can be learned and improved with practice.

# Public Speaking Cannot Be Practiced Alone
While you can rehearse your material individually, public speaking is fundamentally a ***performance***.  You need an audience, even a small and friendly one, to truly practice.  Feedback, interaction, and adapting to a live audience are crucial for growth.  Think of it like a dress rehearsal – you need to run the whole show to identify what works and what needs refinement.

# How to Start
## Self-Confidence vs. Self-Esteem
A key foundation for effective public speaking is self-esteem, which differs from self-confidence.
- **Self-Confidence**: This is belief in your ability to perform a specific task. You can build self-confidence by practicing and succeeding in small steps.
- **Self-Esteem**: This is a broader sense of self-worth and value. It's the bedrock upon which self-confidence is built. If you have healthy self-esteem, setbacks are less likely to derail you.

Building self-esteem is crucial before seriously tackling public speaking.  Here are some ways to cultivate it:
- **Focus on your strengths**: Identify what you do well and celebrate those accomplishments.
- **Challenge negative self-talk**: Recognize and reframe negative thoughts. Replace "I can't do this" with "I'll practice and improve."
- **Set realistic goals**: Start small and build momentum. Don't try to conquer a huge presentation right away.
- **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, especially when you make mistakes. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
- **Seek supportive feedback**: Surround yourself with people who encourage you and offer constructive criticism.
- ***Appreciate small wins***: Acknowledge and celebrate even the smallest achievements in your life, both inside and outside of public speaking. Recognizing your progress and successes, no matter how small, reinforces your sense of competence and builds positive momentum. This could be anything from successfully delivering a single point in a practice run to receiving positive feedback on a small project at work.

## Message vs Content
It's important to distinguish between your message and your content.  While related, they are not the same.
- **Message**: This is the core takeaway you want your audience to remember. It's the single, overarching idea you're trying to convey. It should be concise and memorable. Think of it as the headline of your presentation.
- **Content**: This is the supporting material you use to explain and reinforce your message. It includes your facts, data, stories, examples, and arguments. Your content should be carefully selected and organized to effectively support your message.

A clear message is essential.  Without a strong message, your content, no matter how well-researched, will lack focus and impact.  ***Always start by defining your message before developing your content.***
