This document summarizes key takeaways from our internal public speaking training.  It's intended for personal review and reinforcement.

This post will guide you through preparing content for public speaking.

# Step One: Choosing the Level of Your Message

 Select one of the three levels of message: **Inform** (answers "What"), **Inspire** (answers "Why"), and **Influence** (answers "Why you? Why me?"). Each level serves different contexts.

 *   **Inform**: This level focuses on delivering facts and data. The audience should remember the core takeaway.
     *   Example: A presentation about the latest marketing trends, detailing statistics and changes in consumer behavior. The message is, "These are the new trends."
 *   **Inspire**: This level aims to motivate and create emotional connections. It should answer the question of why.
     *   Example: A speech about overcoming challenges to achieve a goal. The message is, "Resilience leads to success."
 *   **Influence**: This level seeks to persuade the audience. The content should explain why the audience should choose you or a specific idea.
     *   Example: A pitch for a new product, highlighting its unique benefits and why it's better than the competition. The message is, "Our product is the best solution for your needs."

# Step Two: Building a Solid Structure

 Your structure needs three parts: **introduction**, **body**, and **conclusion**. The introduction and conclusion will be covered in later sections.

 The body needs main points (ideas) and supporting evidence. New speakers should start with a three-point structure. 

 There are many ways to provide evidence to support the main points. The simplest and most effective way for beginners is **storytelling**. Skill in providing evidence helps you speak more, fluently, and effectively.

**Example structure**:
*   Message level: Inform
*   Message: Public speaking involves content, delivery, and audience connection.
*   *Main point 1*: Content is the information you share.
    *   Supporting evidence: Share a story about how well-researched content made a presentation successful.
*   *Main point 2*: Delivery is how you present the message, including tone and body language.
    *   Supporting evidence: Share a story about how effective delivery engaged an audience.
*   *Main point 3*: Audience connection builds rapport through understanding audience needs.
    *   Supporting evidence: Share a story about adapting a presentation to better meet audience needs and interests.

While drafting your content, always remember:
 * The main points must support the message and the chosen level of the message. 
 * The evidence must support the main points.

# Step Three: Telling DETAILED, SPECIFIC Stories

Here are the essential elements of a good story:

 *   **Specific time, place, and numbers**: Specifics ground your story and make it more believable.
 *   **The problem and its severity**: What was at stake?
 *   **The lesson/solution and its value to the listener**: What did you learn, and how can the audience apply it to their own lives?

 When choosing details to serve the storytelling, remember: **a good detail is one that touches at least one of the listener's five senses.**

 *   Example incorporating details:
     *   **Main point**: Audience connection builds rapport through understanding audience needs.
     *   **Supporting evidence**:
         *  ***Without detail***: I once had to change my presentation on the fly. The audience was bored. I realized they wanted something different, so I changed it and they were happy.
         *  **With detail (better)**: "It was 9 AM on a Tuesday at the Marketing Summit in downtown Chicago. I was presenting the quarterly results to a room of 50 marketing professionals. I could see glazed-over eyes and people checking their phones [**visual**]. The problem: they needed actionable insights, not just data. I paused, scratched the next 10 slides, and asked them about their biggest challenges. We spent the next hour workshopping solutions together. The lesson: Always know your audience's needs. By tailoring the presentation to address their specific pain points, I not only regained their attention but also provided real value that they could implement immediately, leading to a 15% increase in engagement scores."
