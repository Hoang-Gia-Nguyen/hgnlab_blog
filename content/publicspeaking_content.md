This document summarizes key takeaways from our internal public speaking training. It's intended for personal review and reinforcement, focusing on **crafting compelling content** for **impactful presentations**.

This post will guide you through preparing content for **public speaking**.

# Step One: Choosing the Level of Your Message for Effective Communication

Select one of the three levels of message: **Inform** (answers "What"), **Inspire" (answers "Why"), and **Influence** (answers "Why you? Why me?"). Each level serves different contexts for **effective communication** and **presentation skills**.

*   **Inform**: This level focuses on delivering facts and data. The audience should remember the core takeaway. This is key for **presentation skills**.
    *   Example: A presentation about the latest marketing trends, detailing statistics and changes in consumer behavior. The message is, "These are the new trends."
*   **Inspire**: This level aims to motivate and create emotional connections. It should answer the question of why.
    *   Example: A speech about overcoming challenges to achieve a goal. The message is, "Resilience leads to success."
*   **Influence**: This level seeks to persuade the audience. The content should explain why the audience should choose you or a specific idea.
    *   Example: A pitch for a new product, highlighting its unique benefits and why it's better than the competition. The message is, "Our product is the best solution for your needs."

# Step Two: Building a Solid Content Structure for Presentations

Your structure needs three parts: **introduction**, **body**, and **conclusion**. The introduction and conclusion will be covered in later sections. This is crucial for **structuring a speech**.

The body needs main points (ideas) and supporting evidence. New speakers should start with a three-point structure. This is a fundamental aspect of **content structure for presentations**.

There are many ways to provide evidence to support the main points. The simplest and most effective way for beginners is **storytelling**. Skill in providing evidence helps you speak more, fluently, and effectively, enhancing your **presentation skills** and **crafting compelling narratives**.

**Example structure for public speaking content**:
*   Message level: Inform
*   Message: **Public speaking** involves content, delivery, and audience connection.
*   *Main point 1*: Content is the information you share.
    *   Supporting evidence: Share a story about how well-researched content made a presentation successful.
*   *Main point 2*: Delivery is how you present the message, including tone and body language.
    *   Supporting evidence: Share a story about how effective delivery engaged an audience.
*   *Main point 3*: Audience connection builds rapport through understanding audience needs.
    *   Supporting evidence: Share a story about adapting a presentation to better meet audience needs and interests.

While drafting your content, always remember:
*   The main points must support the message and the chosen level of the message.
*   The evidence must support the main points.

# Step Three: Telling DETAILED, SPECIFIC Stories

Here are the essential elements of a good story:

 *   **Specific time, place, and numbers**: Specifics ground your story and make it more believable.
 *   **The problem and its severity**: What was at stake?
 *   **The lesson/solution and its value to the listener**: What did you learn, and how can the audience apply it to their own lives?

 When choosing details to serve the storytelling, remember: **a good detail is one that touches at least one of the listener's five senses.**

 *   Example incorporating details:
     *   **Main point**: Audience connection builds rapport through understanding audience needs.
     *   **Supporting evidence**:
         *  ***Without detail***: I once had to change my presentation on the fly. The audience was bored. I realized they wanted something different, so I changed it and they were happy.
         # Step Three: Telling DETAILED, SPECIFIC Stories in Presentations

Here are the essential elements of a good story for **storytelling in presentations** and achieving **audience engagement**:

*   **Specific time, place, and numbers**: Specifics ground your story and make it more believable.
*   **The problem and its severity**: What was at stake?
*   **The lesson/solution and its value to the listener**: What did you learn, and how can the audience apply it to their own lives?

When choosing details to serve the storytelling, remember: **a good detail is one that touches at least one of the listener's five senses.** This helps create **engaging presentations**.

*   Example incorporating details for **engaging presentations**:
    *   **Main point**: Audience connection builds rapport through understanding audience needs.
        *   ***Without detail***: I once had to change my presentation on the fly. The audience was bored. I realized they wanted something different, so I changed it and they were happy.
        *   **With detail (better)**: "It was 9 AM on a Tuesday at the Marketing Summit in downtown Chicago. I was presenting the quarterly results to a room of 50 marketing professionals. I could see glazed-over eyes and people checking their phones [**visual**]. The problem: they needed actionable insights, not just data. I paused, scratched the next 10 slides, and asked them about their biggest challenges. We spent the next hour workshopping solutions together. The lesson: Always know your audience's needs. By tailoring the presentation to address their specific pain points, I not only regained their attention but also provided real value that they could implement immediately, leading to a 15% increase in engagement scores."
