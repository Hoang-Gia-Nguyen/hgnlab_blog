# Vocal Delivery
Vocal delivery, encompassing how you use your voice, is a powerful tool for conveying meaning and emotion.  Effective vocal delivery relies on conscious vocal projection and variation.
## 3 Levels of Vocal Delivery
1. **Mumbling/Under-Projecting**: This is the absence of effective projection.  The voice is quiet, unclear, and lacks energy. It makes it difficult for the listener to understand and engage with the message.  This is what we want to avoid.
2. **Loud, Clear, and Fluent**: This is the *ideal* level.  The voice is projected strongly enough to be easily heard and understood, the articulation is clear, and the delivery is smooth and confident.  This allows your intonation to shine through and effectively convey meaning.  It's "loud enough for the listener to feel that you want to speak, clear enough for the listener to grasp all the content, fluent means no stumbling."
3. **Natural Emotion/Expressive**: This builds upon the "loud, clear, and fluent" level.  Here, you incorporate a wider range of intonation, pace, and emphasis to convey genuine emotion and connect with the audience on a deeper level.  Your voice reflects the nuances of your message, making it more engaging and persuasive.

## 5 Elements of Vocal Delivery
These five elements work together to create effective vocal delivery:
1. **Speed (Pace)**: The rate at which you speak. Varying your pace can create dramatic effect. Slow down for important points, speed up for less critical information.
2. **Intensity (Volume)**: The loudness or softness of your voice. Use volume to emphasize key words or phrases.
3. **Pitch**: The highness or lowness of your voice. Varying your pitch prevents monotony.
4. **Duration**: The length of time you spend on a sound or syllable. Varying duration can emphasize certain words or phrases. Holding a key word slightly longer can draw attention to it.
5. **Timbre (Tone)**: The unique quality of your voice. While less consciously controllable, being aware of your timbre can help you project confidence and warmth. A warm timbre can be more engaging than a harsh one.

# Body Language
Your body language speaks volumes, often more than your words.  It can reinforce your message or contradict it entirely.
## 3 Levels of Body Language
1. **Awkward/Distracting**: This level is characterized by nervous fidgeting, unnatural gestures, poor posture, and lack of eye contact.  These distractions detract from your message and make you appear unconfident.  This is what we want to *avoid*.
2. **Steady/Controlled**: At this level, your body language is more deliberate and composed.  You maintain good posture, use some gestures, and make occasional eye contact.  While better than "awkward," it can still feel somewhat stiff and lack dynamism.
3. **Flexible and Lively/Engaging**: This is the *ideal* level.  Your body language is natural, expressive, and engaging.  You use a variety of gestures, make consistent eye contact, move purposefully, and your facial expressions are congruent with your message.  Your body language reinforces your message and helps you connect with the audience.

## 4 Factors That Affect Body Language
These four factors are crucial for effective body language:

1. **Eyes**: Maintain consistent eye contact with different members of your audience. This demonstrates confidence, sincerity, and engagement.
2. **Hands**: Use your hands to gesture naturally and purposefully. Avoid distracting fidgeting or keeping your hands rigidly at your sides.
3. **Posture**: Stand or sit with good posture. This projects confidence and authority. Avoid slouching or slumping.
4. **Movement**: Move purposefully and avoid pacing nervously. Use movement to engage different parts of the audience and emphasize key points.
