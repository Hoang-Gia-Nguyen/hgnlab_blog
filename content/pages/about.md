# Hello, World!

Hi everyone, I'm a Senior Software Test Engineer with 7+ years of experience in the automotive industry, specializing in the development of test automation solutions.

Lately, I've become increasingly interested in the world of self-hosting.  The idea of taking control of my own data and services is really appealing.  I'm currently experimenting with setting up various applications and tools on an old laptop that I've repurposed as a home server.  It's a fun and rewarding learning experience!

I've decided to start this blog as a way to document my self-hosting journey, share what I've learned, and hopefully connect with others who are also exploring this space. I believe that writing is a great way to solidify my understanding of concepts and also helps to share knowledge with the community.  So, consider this my "Hello, World!" to the blogging world.  I'm excited to see where this adventure takes me!
